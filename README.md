# Automation for Cyber Security - 2025 Semester 2
## ICTPRG434 ICTPRG435
This unit is part of the Certificate IV Cybersecurity course.

As an introduction to scripting and programming this is a basic cluster (group of units) included in a cybersecurity course.

  ## What is this?
    This is a section where code for units ICTPRG434 & ICTPRG435 live.
    Files will be uploaded and pushed during class.
  ## Gaining Access
    This is a public Git Repo so anyone can access it.
## Suggestion
  1. The first suggestion is that students write their own code and do their own work.
    This repo should be used for checking and catch-up.
  2. It is suggested students use their own repo to store code and get used to the process.


#### Note:
There are multiple ways to write code and the suggestions here are for ease of use and understanding.
It by no means is the likely best way to write nor will it follow all best practices.
